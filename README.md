# resize-image-using-python
When the python image is resized, the interpolation method defines how the new pixels are computed. There are several interpolation techniques, each of which has its own quality vs. speed trade-offs. It is important to note that resizing an image can reduce its quality. 
exp1a:- image resize
 Scaling operations increase or reduce the size of an image. 
exp1b:- Image Rotation
Images can be rotated to any degree clockwise or otherwise. We just need to define rotation matrix listing rotation point, degree of rotation and the scaling factor. 
exp1:- Image Translation
Translating an image means shifting it within a given frame of reference that can be along the x-axis and y-axis.
